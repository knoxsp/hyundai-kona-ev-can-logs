# BMS Diagnostics

These CAN log sessions were captured by a user from [Dala's EV Discord](https://www.patreon.com/dala), and show a diagnostic tool (UDS CAN IDs 7E4/7EC) running diagnostic procedures to close contactors, etc.

This is from a Kona 2021 64kWh battery pack connected directly to power and PCAN, with no other components connected.

*Important: It's unclear what (if any) safeguards are in place while these diagnostic procedures are running.*
